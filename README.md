# CS3010FinalProject



# Instructions: 
```
Design a program to solve these differential equations:
x'''''= x''''+y+z+t'+p''''
y'''''=  y+x''
z'''''= z+y''''
t'''''= z''''+z''+z+y
p'''''=x+y+z+t+p
```

# Notes:
## 3 different functions: 
<ins>Sum</ins>
* 
<ins>Integrate</ins>
* 
<ins>Equate</ins>
* if the finished equation is completed, then equate will return true

## Output
* No output is needed -> just say successful/unsuccessful
